## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate majoring in computer sciences and mathematics at <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. My research interest lies in the intersection of **computer systems** and **machine learning**. It is my great fortune to work with <a href="https://shivaram.org/" target="_blank">Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman</a> and <a href="https://minjiazhang.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Minjia Zhang</a>.
